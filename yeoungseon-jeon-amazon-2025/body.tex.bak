Dear Members of the Amazon Fellowship Selection Committee:

\textbf{I strongly recommend Youngseung Jeon for an Amazon PhD Fellowship}. I
have had the privilege of collaborating with Youngseung over the past year and a
half. In our collaboration, Youngseung has been leading an interdisciplinary
project focused on developing human-centered AI tools for scientific discovery.
This work is \textbf{already supported by a collaborative 2024 Science Hub
project} ("Human-Centered Design of AI Systems to Support Drug Discovery")
awarded to Anthony Chen (UCLA ECE), and John Varghese (UCLA Medical School), and
me. In my research advising and collaboration, Youngseung stands out in his
\textbf{interdisciplinarity as a researcher} and \textbf{leader mentoring
younger students}.

In his research, Youngseung integrates theories about human creativity, the
human-centered design process, and AI model development. Each requires a
distinct set of skills and knowledge, and I have seen Youngseung integrate them
all in his work on HAPPIER and GRAPPI. \textbf{Youngseung's perspective is that
AI models alone are not enough for supporting scientific discovery.} These
models must facilitate critical aspects of scientits' workflows and allow
scientists to express what they can. In other words, the development of AI
models cannot be totally separate from the settings in which they are intended
to be used. \textbf{This approach is new and different from much of the existing
AI-centric work on scientific discovery.} As a result, Youngseung has been
\textbf{collaborating with Varghese's UCLA Drug Discovery Lab on Alzheimer's research}
and \textbf{exploring additional directions with Morteza Ziyadi at Amazon
Applied Science}. An Amazon Fellowship would further the collaborations
Youngseung has already sought out in medicine and in CS, including at Amazon,
thereby increasing the likelihood of success of this refreshing approach to
AI-driven science. 
% Given Amazon's investment in the emergent area in human-centered AI for
% scientific discovery already, 

Furthermore, \textbf{an Amazon Fellowship for Youngseung would be a longer-term
investment in future researchers focused on real-world AI problems}. This is
because Youngseung actively mentors students and is able to train them to become
productive contributors to his projects. I have seen how through Youngseung's
mentorship, students without clear project goals or roles, take ownership of
parts of projects and become committed team members. For example, a student who
was new to web development was able to implement the entire frontend of HAPPIER
with Youngseung.

I am excited to see where Youngseung goes as an \textbf{exemplary researcher at
the intersection of human-computer interaction, AI, and the sciences}! I can
only hope that Amazon will be part of this future.
